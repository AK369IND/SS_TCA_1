# SS_TCA_1

I tried deploying on Github pages, it couldn't display jinja2 content even though I followed all instructions.
I tried deploying on heroku, it build with 0 errors, all dependencies done, yet the app link displays error.

But the app runs on local server. To run the app via bash terminal:

py -m venv venv
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install flask
python -m flask run
